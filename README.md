# QuizGame

In this quiz/trivia game, all Im trying to achieve is learning the basics of game develepoment, pygame, and basic UI creation

The game started with simple inputting system where the user was given a question and was expeted to enter the correct answer
The questions were pulled from a txt file and it was a simple game

After that I tried to change the database of questions from txt file to an excel file which made me learn about pandas  library
I learned it and finally was able to have my questions in a neat database
After that I added A B C D choices to my questions and user was able to choose the answer amongst them

Shortly after I started using pygame.
Addition of pygame was like adding an extra dimension. everything had to be changed accoring to it
Which I managed to do

After having this fully functioning game, it wasn't enough for me so I changed the way I blit/draw thing on my screen
I created class for all my boxes, some were clickable some were not.

Currently I am trying to finalise the game with making this class work. After that the game will be basically over.
I might add some gamemodes to game sometime.

But what I will keep on doing is I will add more quesitons to database until I have around 1000 questions.
